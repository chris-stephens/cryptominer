## Building a Crypto-Currency Miner

### Background
I built a crypto-currency miner in late 2013 and was able to mine some LiteCoin which ended up having a small value at the time.  I decided to not mine BitCoin because the mining network difficulty had risen beyond being profitable for GPU hardware (only custom ASICs were profitable at the time).

In late 2017, I decided to get back into cryptocurrency and build another mining machine.  My 2013 experiment had 4 AMD GPU's that were very power-hungry, loud, and generated a ton of heat.  My goal this time was to build a condensed desktop miner that didn't generate too much noise or heat, so I decided to go with a single GPU setup and mini-ITX motherboard/case.  

### Parts List

[EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Video Card](http://amzn.to/2qzImd3) - Amazing graphics card with NVidia chip.  Lower power and more efficient design.  Unfortunately, the most costly part of the build.
[Thermaltake Core V1 Mini ITX Cube Case](http://amzn.to/2EkbcjM) - I wanted a sleek and clean case (as compared to the milk crate for my last build), so I went with this model.
[BIOSTAR A68N-5545 AMD A8-5545 Motherboard/CPU](http://amzn.to/2m3hPiM) - I picked this motherboard/CPU combo because it was low cost and low power.  It includes a quad-core CPU and single PCIe x16 slot.
[EVGA 750 GQ, 80+ GOLD 750W Power Supply](http://amzn.to/2D4ZQ3t) - The GPU required about 600W to be safe, so I went with this gold-efficiency PSU.
[Samsung 850 EVO 500GB SSD](http://amzn.to/2D2CziG) - You could probably get by with a smaller drive, but this worked for me.  I wanted to make sure I had enough capacity to run a full BitCoin node in the future (~160GB right now).
[Corsair Vengeance Blue 16 GB (2x8 GB) DDR3](http://amzn.to/2m6ii3M) - Another component that probably could have been cheaper.  I already had this, so I decided to use it.
[Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor](http://amzn.to/2CNkR51) - Optional eletrical outlet usage monitor.  This will allow you to calculate how much electricity your mining rig will use.

Total cost for me was about $960 since I already had the SSD and memory from an old project.  You could probably cut some costs with a cheaper power supply, however the $80 CPU/motherboard combination in the list above can't be beat.  Keep in mind that a powerful CPU isn't important, since the GPU will be doing most of the work.

### Build Process

Once you have all the parts


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/chris-stephens/cryptominer/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/chris-stephens/cryptominer/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
